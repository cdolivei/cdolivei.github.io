Title: Do not register third-level .name domains
summary: Very few registrars support this. Avoid using it

A number of years ago, I brought a foo.bar.name domain - otherwise known as a third-level domain. The .name domain is bit unusual as it is meant for personal use. Because lots of people share the same last time, it's pretty common that second-level domains like bar.name to be reserved. In many cases, you can only register third-level domains.

Sometime in 2023 my registrar, Gandi, [got acquired][1] and they raised their prices. Annoyed, I've been trying to transfer my .name out (along with my other domains), but this was turning into a giant headache!

Many registrars do not support .name domains. Of those that do, almost none of them support third-level .name domains. Not Namecheap (confirmed via support), not [dynadot][2], not... ughhh, GoDaddy.

[webnames][3] _does_ support third-level domains, but at a more expensive price than Gandi ðŸ¤· and at roughly 3x the cost of Namecheap ðŸ’°

In the process, I learned that [Namecheap competes with itself](https://www.namecheap.com/about/press-releases/24-04-16/the-new-domain-registration-web-services-platform-spaceship-wants-to-help-shape-the-unseen-future-internet/), but Spaceship doesn't even support .name domains.

Ultimately I decided to just ditch the .name domain. Thankfully I don't use it for many things (even though it's my favourite domain)

As an aside, one option I did consider was registering foobar.name instead. But I really like the foo.bar.name format.
