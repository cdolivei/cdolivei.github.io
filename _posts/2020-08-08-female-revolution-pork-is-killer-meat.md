>From the beginning of civiliation<br>
They say the pig is ugly<br>
Man try they've run from the sickness<br>
Man try they've run from disease<br>
Every day Jah children they play<br>
But they don't know the danger awaits<br>
And they say achoo<br>
And they say achoo<br>
Now the Romans and the Pharisees<br>
They eat it every night (every night)<br>
But Jah the Holy One<br>
He told them it was wrong (it was wrong)<br>
And many a people of today<br>
Don't try to understand (understand)<br>
I try to reason and explain<br>
But they always shame me in disgrace<br>
