> Don't know how<br>
> <br>
> We believe peace begins within (x2)<br>
> <br>
> Don't like war<br>
> Give us peace<br>
> Won't you excuse me while I get my release<br>
> Oh me, oh my<br>
> Things so bad<br>
> I cannot cry<br>
> <br>
> We believe peace begins within (x2)<br>
> <br>
> Oh me, oh my<br>
> Want to see heaven<br>
> But I don't want to die<br>
> <br>
