I was rather amused by this appeal to the supreme court of Canada (case [39367]):

> Mr. Stanislaw Szopa immigrated to Canada from Poland in 1981 with his family. In 2018, Mr. Szopa filed a claim against the Government of Canada, alleging that Canadian embassy officials had committed errors and wrongful acts at the time of his immigration, including making negligent misrepresentations which induced Mr. Szopa to immigrate without being informed that his education credentials would not transfer to Canada.

Getting around to it 37 years after arriving? Guess better late than never. Education credentials not being recognized across countries is still a problem even now. Sucks that people have to go through it. Wonder how much he's asking

> Unable to secure employment as an engineer in Canada, Mr. Szopa sought over $23 million in damages, for the socio economic difficulties he and his family suffered since they immigrated to Canada, as well as for mental distress

$600k a year to be an engineer? I picked the wrong field. I should have been a Polish engineer. This whole thing seems like a frivolous lawsuit anyways. But I wonder what kind of $23m lawyer would fight this sort of case?

> Party: Szopa, Stanislaw
> This party is not represented by counsel.

Oh. Dude you need a [better lawyer]
