Me: Hello do you sell birch plywood?

<acronym title="Customer Service Representative">CSR</acronym>: Yes! We sell it 8' x 4'. 8' x 2'..

Me: I need 1 metre by a half metre.

CSR: Oh, we never measure in metric. Always in inches and feet.

Me: Oh...

CSR: Let me see if I can convert that for you \**breaks out smartphone*\* let's see 100 centimetres in a metre.. divided by 2.54 is 39"... and the other side is half of that so it's... 19 and &#xbe; inches...

Me: (since they sell by the foot and not in inches) how many feet in 39 inches?

CSR: Let's see, divide 39 inches by....

(The CSR was very helpful and I don't mean to make fun of him, but rather I was disappointed that measurements for buying lumber still uses imperial units)
