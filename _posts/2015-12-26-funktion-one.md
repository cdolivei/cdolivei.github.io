This autumn I visited Vancouver for vacation and visited a club. I noticed this club had some pretty unusal speakers, but didn't know who made these.

Turns out it was a [Funktion One Resolution 2] speaker (Funktion One is quite well known and, from what I hear, quite expensive). Most of their other speakers don't look nearly as unique. For having only two speakers in the entire club, they sounded pretty good. I was also hammered the entire time, so take that review with a grain of salt.
