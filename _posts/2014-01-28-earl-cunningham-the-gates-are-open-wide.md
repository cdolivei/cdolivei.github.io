>The gates are open wide<br>
So if you want to come in<br>
You got to let peace and love abide<br>
In your heart<br>
Don't you know?<br><br>
Now all you wicked man<br>
Stop from doing all those wicked things that you doing<br>
Cause on the day, you gonna have to pay<br>
Every knee shall bow and every tongue confess on that day*<br>
So stop what you're doing now<br>
Don't you know?<br>
The father is watching you<br>
With everything that you do<br>
Don't you know?<br><br>
You see your brother walking down the street<br>
You shoot him down and take everything he has<br>
Don't you know<br>
What you doing ain't right<br>
It ain't right, no it ain't right<br>
In the father's eyes<br><br>
Stop doing what you doing<br><br>
My brothers<br><br>
Stop doing what you doing
