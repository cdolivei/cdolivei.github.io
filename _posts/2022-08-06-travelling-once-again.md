After two years of lockdowns and travel restrictions, I'm taking my first trip out of the country in a few days.
In addition, I am planning to travel to Lebanon later this year, which is the furthest west I've ever been!

While this is exciting, it has also been pretty stressful. For 2 years there wasn't much I could do or go. I couldn't travel, and for a while I couldn't go inside a bar,
I couldn't even visit friends. The days all seemed the same. There is something calming about that. Every day is familiar, predictable. Every week is predictable,
and that was somehow... reassuring? and boring

Staying home, I don't have to worry about catching Covid, or getting Monkeypox (or rather, it's a lot less scary when you're not travelling).
I don't have to worry about catching a flight, or whether my bags make it. Or struggling to read French while trying to catch a train. Or whether there will be a
strike keeping me at an airport. etc.

As the day of the trip gets closer, and as I think about the Lebanon trip, I have been getting more uneasy, uncomfortable.
I've been in this awful state of 'worry'. I forgot what adventure (to me) is - not being 100% in control of your environment.

I hope this trip turns out great. I can really use the vacation.
