Approximately 8 months ago I switched blogging platforms to a mix of GitHub and [Jekyll]. In previous blogging platforms I would spend some time finding a theme I like. I took this opportunity to ditch themes and go with some basic CSS. While it looks ugly, some things come free ("Responsive design"? &#x2713; Mobile-friendly? &#x2713; Works on pretty much every browser? [&#x2713;][every browser]), and it'll likely work for browsers that aren't even [released][servo] or invented yet.

The motivation to do this goes back to my old [BlackBerry Bold 9780][bb9780] phone whose browser and capabilities were so limited that I had to turn off images and javascript when surfing the web, because otherwise I would risk crashing my browser. The other reason for switching off images/js was that many sites took too long to load over 3G. So I began to really prefer text-only sites that were much easier to navigate.

Overall pretty happy with the website, though certainly not a good portfolio item to show off :)
