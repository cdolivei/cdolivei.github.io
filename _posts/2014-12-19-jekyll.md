Title: Trying Jekyll
summary: Trying Yet Another Blogging platform

A number of <del>weeks</del>months ago I tried [Ghost Blog][Ghost] to possibly replace my [WordPress] blog.
That experiment was done for a number of reasons that I won't outline here. I will say that Ghost is pretty good for a minimal blogging solution.
It is much more narrow in scope than WordPress is, which is something that I was looking for at the time.

However Ghost's minimalism had a cost as well. Some pain points were:

* No plugins. Every update required me to re-install [Disqus] to the proper template. This is planned <acronym title="As Far As I Know">AFAIK</acronym>
* Constant updates (at [~2 weeks][ghost releases] at the time of writing) but no automatic updates.

Now for a fair price you can pay Ghost to automatically update your blog. But at [$10/month][ghost pricing], it costs more than hosting and for a infrequent
blogger such as myself, it doesn't make sense. I'm lucky to hit 10 blog views a month.

Due to those pain points, I've decided to jump ship and try [Jekyll]. It's not perfect (I miss my Markdown [WYSIWTF] editor). But it has some nice benefits.
Fairly simple, lightweight, and I feel less guilty for avoiding the updates!

PS. I hate updates. But that's another post.
