title: A covid-19 update

We are approximately 3.5 months since lockdown started because of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the last time I blogged was mid November - which is incidently around when the first reported cases of COVID-19 started, so I'm not ruling out the possibility that it is somehow related, but I figure I write about some stuff I learned.

1. I wrote a code interpreter! I wrote it in C# and basically ~copied~ learned from [Lisperator]. Nothing special, it only supported integers and floats and variables. I added support for negatives! wow! Seriously though, it was fun to write, and I learned about taking a complicated idea and breaking those down into smaller problems.
2. I tried to write a powershell formatter. There is a fair bit of overlap with the above project. Lucky there is a built-in powershell parser that spits out both a series of tokens, and an <abbr title="Abstract Syntax Tree">AST</abbr>. I started with the token approach, but moved to using ASTs. I started working on this because we write a lot of Powershell code at work, but we didn't use any code formatter. It turned out that two formatters exist - [PowerShell Beautifier] and cleverly hidden inside the [PSScriptAnalyzer] is `Invoke-Formatter`. The former has some issues though.
3. I grabbed an [AKAI MidiMix] and have been playing with it. My goal is to make some sort of poor-man's [reggae preamp] - though a lot less cooler and much more limited. I've only really just started with it, and I have no idea what I'm doing.

I haven't bothered putting any of these projects under source control as I never planned on releasing them. I think having throw-away projects provides a lot of value even if they never make it outside my machine.
