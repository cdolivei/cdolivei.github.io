When the [canvas API][canvas] came out a number of years ago, I made a simple website to learn something about it. It was basically a white canvas that people can draw on it. Nothing super fancy, just 300x300 pixels that you can draw black lines on and save.

I think I made one mention of it in foxymonkies and that's it, and pretty much forgotten about it. Until recently.

It turns out that there 442 user-created images over that time (some blank, but [uniq] isn't filtering them out so there might be a dot or something odd there). Since I don't keep a timestamp, I have no idea how recently these images were generated. Since there is no name, I have no idea who created most of these (most of them were definitely not me).

So I'm releasing it for **your** viewing pleasure and entertainment. Some of these are kinda nsfw if you work at some lame company where [Michelangelo's David][penis] is nsfw.

To not lose my 2 RSS viewers, I have moved the [400+ doodles] into a seperate link.
