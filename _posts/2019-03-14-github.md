I recently updated my blog url and it required making a change in GitHub because that's where my blog is hosted (using the excellent [GitHub pages][ghpages]). Basically you need to update your DNS and make some changes to the project settings.

However I noticed some interesting commits in my repository:

![a picture showing the project commit history, with several commits coming from me][commits]

All the commits show as coming from my name or cdolivei (my GitHub commit handle). There are 2 ways that I commit to my repository:

1. I use the git command line
2. I create blog posts using the in-browser editor - which is helpful because it gives a rendered preview of Markdown

However three of the commits, which shows as coming from cdolivei, I did not explicitly commit. All three are around the CNAME change.

GitHub is doesn't really mention doing this both on the project settings page and in their [custom domain docs][customdomainpage], but basically when you add/modify the custom domain setting in the project settings page, it automatically add/updates the CNAME file in the repository. While this is a user experience improvement over creating the file yourself, if I was to ask people "How often should GitHub make a commit in your repository on your behalf?" the answer for most people would probably be never.

Maybe the solution is to start signing my commits? :(

GitHub is very popular and a trusted source for millions of projects, and to me, even though the commit is harmless, errodes that trust.
