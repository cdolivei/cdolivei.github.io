>I see rain I see fire.  
I see rain I see fire  
This is the time of tribulation.  
The publican claims its inflation.  
Iron sharpeneth iron.  
The Sadducees them don't know.  
That I and I a lion.  
I and I a lion.  
I and I a lion.  
  
>I see the Messiah From the tribe of Judeah  
Selassie I is the Trinity.  
Oh, three in one  
and one in three.  
Is the Trinity,  
the Trinity.  
  
>Said I read it in the Prophecy.  
Read it children  
Seven years of plenty, yeah.  
Seven years of famine.  
That I never see on this earth before.  
  
>Seven years of plenty, yeah.  
Seven years of famine.  
That I never see on this earth before.  
  
>He that is on the housetop.  
Won't have time to come down.  
He that leave his tool in the fields.  
Won't have time to pick it up.  
For tribulation and inflation.  
Cover this land.  
It's only Jah Jah.  
Can solve this pollution  
  
>I see rain I see fire.  
I see rain I see fire
