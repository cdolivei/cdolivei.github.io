_(This post was going to turn into an incredibly long bitchy rant about crappy directions, bad/lack of signs, and my overall frustration about finding a stop that doesn't exist; but it's bedtime and I don't want to think about this anymore)_

Today I needed to make a trip to IKEA and the closest location is in Etobicoke. There is a shuttle bus that goes from Kipling station to IKEA. This is the instructions on their [website][ikea etobicoke] to get to the shuttle:

> "The complimentary IKEA Shuttle leaves the north side of the subway (off of Dundas Street) on Subway crescent/IKEA every 30 minutes"

The location and size of Kipling station makes actually finding the shuttle bus stop very difficult to someone not familiar with the station and the area. Here is the location of the [shuttle]. It is right in front of a giant transmission line and there is absolutely no fucking sign.
