I clicked on a [Forbes] link today with my ad blocker turned on and was greeted with a message:

> *"Thanks for coming to Forbes. Please turn off your ad blocker in order to continue. To thank you for doing so, weâ€™re happy to present you with an ad-light experience."*

That sounds like something you should be offering all your users. Hovering over "ad-light" showed me this:

> "Forbes Ad Light provides you a less intrusive advertising experience for 30 days.
> <ul>
>	<li>No welcome ad when entering the site</li>
>	<li>Faster load time for ads</li>
>	<li>No auto-play videos</li>
>	<li>No video ad overlay</li>
> </ul>
>
> Please enjoy this experience as we work to finalize its various components."

Great! So wen my 30 days are up I can go back to their ad-heavy version and get:
<ul>
	<li>A welcome ad when entering the site</li>
	<li>Slow load time for ads</li>
	<li>Auto-play videos</li>
	<li>Video ad overlay</li>
</ul>

No thank you!
