I have owned my Blackberry Bold 9780 for nearly 3 years now - which is like 120 in smartphone years. It's showing its age<sup>1</sup>. RIM doesn't support it, and in fact is actively harming it with the latest BBM updates that are touch-optimized. So I began thinking about a new phone.

## Blackberry
Pros:

* Keyboard. I have *not* gotten used to a touchscreen keyboard. This is a highly subjective but *extremely* important quality in a phone. No super-secret-awesome keyboard app sauce is going replace a keyboard. I will say that touch keyboards have gone a long way, but it's still not there for me.

Cons:

* App support is pretty shit. The apps they do have is pretty shit as well. Often a third-tier platform.
* Honestly it feels like the company is staying afloat until it gets a buyer. I'll give credit to the [new CEO however for putting the loltrain back on track][1].

## Apple

Not much complaints. It seems to be a very polished phone. There has been lots of complaints for the walled-garden approach that has taken, at least in the beginning. But it works out well for Apple, and arguably for it's users. The biggest con by far is the price - approximately $700, or half a new computer. If it was perfect, it's a bargain price. But nothing is perfect.

## Android

I have been cautious of Android mainly because of Google's involvement in it. Unlike Blackberry, Apple, or Windows, Google probably knows the most about me and the real value I provide is the more data it collects about me.

My friend [Tom] recently lent me a Samsung phone and I played around with it. I used a new e-mail address, and found it to be fun to use for games or just browsing. I ended up getting an Android tablet for this very reason.

## Windows

I really want to give this a try but WIND *just* stopped selling them. Finding an unlocked WIND compatible phone is turning out to be more work than I want to put in.

## Result

How do I Grindr on a flip phone?
