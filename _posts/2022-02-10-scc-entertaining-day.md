So sometimes I listen in to the Supreme court hearings, and they're mostly boring so I don't listen in for very long, but sometimes interesting. But today was especially entertaining. Some poor lawyer was being absolutely chewed out by one of the justices because he believes the they (legal counsel) was purposely prolonging the case to so that it would be tossed. Like he's seriously being chewed out, to the point where the lawyer asks the chief justice if he could make his closing statement and the chief justice just has this huge grin on his face saying "yeah, I'll let you go"

There was another earlier point where one (defendant) lawyer was like "yeah this (one) document is basically rubbish and unreliable. The prosecutor didn't even use it. blah blah blah" (she was trying to help her client) and one of the justices responded with "you know this document is part of the defense of one of the co-accused?" and the lawyer just smiles and responds in a way that kinda threw the other person under the bus. Like "yeah I know. I'll let my friend (in reference to co-accused lawyer) respond to that". Such a hot mess express today

This particular case is [Her Majesty the Queen v. MÃ©lanie Ste-Marie, et al.][1]
