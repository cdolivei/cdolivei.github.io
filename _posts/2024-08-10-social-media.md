I recently deactivated my Facebook account, for maybe the 3rd time. I don't really use it, most of my friends don't really use it (or at least, don't post). But one thing that Facebook does well is that it reminds you that you regularly used it! It would show me posts I either wrote or was tagged in years ago.

Once upon a time, Facebook was pretty good. Privacy/ethical issues aside, your feed was full of things your friends were doing, and people invited you to events, and you can write whatever you wanted and people you haven't spoken to for months/years would reply! Today, it doesn't feel like any of those things. I say "feel" because I don't actually know for sure â€” I stopped posting there a while ago. I don't remember when/why I stopped posting.

What makes going back to Facebook impossible today is that it is completely overrun by AI and bots. Not only did I stop enjoying it, the AI generated art was starting to get emotionally draining because that's the posts that get engagement. Recently I learned there was a subreddit to showcase the AI "art" that has taken over my newsfeed - [r/FacebookAIslop](https://www.reddit.com/r/FacebookAIslop/)

What a shame
